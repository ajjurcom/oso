# Add Oso to a Node.js Application

{{% coming_soon %}}

In the meantime, here are some resources that might help you get started.

## NestJS library by Bjerk AS

The good folks at [Bjerk AS](https://bjerk.io/) have made a
[NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) integration for Oso freely available via
[GitHub](https://github.com/bjerkio/nestjs-oso#readme) and
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nestjs-oso).
Its documentation includes a Quickstart guide.

## Sam's blog post

Oso CTO Sam Scott blogged about [Adding Authorization to a Node.js
App](https://www.osohq.com/post/adding-authorization-nodejs-app-beyond-role-based-access-control).
That post also uses [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) as a framework,
but without the adapter library above. It also explores some common
authorization patterns and how to express them in that framework.
